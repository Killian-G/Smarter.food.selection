## RimWorld Smarter Food Selection Mod 

### Partially discontinued project

This was an early project of mine...
I am done with RimWorld. The project is being kept alive by an occasional contributor.
Text me if you are interested in contribution to the mod.

### About

Make your all pawns (colonists, animals, prisoners) smart about food selection.
Allows you to set a food policy for your pawns.
Comes with many improvements.

### Features

* Food restriction and optimization
  * Restrict food to meals only. Never eat the precious ingredients again !
  * Never let your pet eat your crops again
  * Prioritize low-end meals for prisoners and ascetic
  * Animal food selection priority by race and policy: Animals won't eat whatever is close to them anymore and prioritize, grass for herbivores, corpses for carnivores, will prefer hunt when capable and so on
 * Create highly customizable policies files. <a href="Mods/WM%20Smarter%20Food%20Selection/Defs/Policies">See examples</a>
* Nutrient paste dispenser enhancements
  * Manually dispense food
  * Use the NPD inside prisons to feed injured / downed prisoners
  * Optimized ingredients selection
* Caravans
  * Food selection applies to caravans
#### More features
* Meals mood boost affects food selection with standard policies
* Optimized taming / training food
  * (Optional) use corpses and meals for training when optimal
* Debugging
  * Cycle throught the policy display mode by pressing "\"

### Mod compatibility

SFS is compatibile with most mods that add new types of food.
The mod will use a generic food categorization. You can overwrite this behavior using compatibility patches. 
<a href="Mods/WM%20Smarter%20Food%20Selection/Defs/CompatibilityPatches">See examples</a>
To see more information about this, print a "compatibility report" from the mods options.
* Combat Extended
  * trying to tame/train with hay or more will make the colonist pick up and drop hay endlessly.
* The mod should be compatible with most mods that add more foods. Such as VG (to be checked).

### Planned features
* UI overhaul (upcoming ;) )
* Change taming policy.
* Complete paste dispenser rework (built-in freezer and storage tbh, pets can use it, smaller meals for small pets).
* Pets will take their dead prey to the nearest storage.
* Change caravans policies.
* Food selection by rot time.
