	PLEASE MOVE YOUR XML FILE INTO Defs/Policies TO USE IT

	Policies can individually assigned to pawns you have control on. (colonists, pets, prisoners but not visitors caravans or allies).
	They will affect their food selection in various ways:
	- Affects the food score to favor some foods on others. Example: favor simple meals over fine meals for prisoners.
	- Forbids certain food.

	I know customizing policies can be tricky to understand !

	Food categories:

	Ignore			: Use this so restricted pawns (prisoners, pets, ascetic or incapacitated colonists) will never be fed with them).
						normaly used for luxuries like chocolate or drugs.
						
	MealAwful		: Anything that gives the "ate awful meal" thought.
	MealSimple		: ...
	MealFine		: Anything that gives the "ate fine meal" thought.
	MealLavish		: Anything that gives the "ate lavish meal" thought.
	
	Hay				: Favorite food of muffalos, after grass. Use if you want your grass eating pets to fetch it first.
	Kibble			: Same as above for kibble.
	
	RawBad			: Raw food, giving bad thoughts.
	RawTasty		: Raw food NOT givin bad thoughts.
	
	Plant			: All crops or trees. Your pets will never eat them.
	Grass			: Favorite food of muffalos, they will always fetch it first. Use only if you have something similar.
	Luxury			: Chocolate or typically "NeverForNutrition" food.
	AnimalProduct	: ...

	all those bellow should never be used.
